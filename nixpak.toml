# This is a starter Nixpak configuration intended for customisation.
# It assumes a Node.js / npm build that produces static assets into `dist/`.

[build]
command = "npm install && npm run build"
artifacts = ["dist"]

[env]
NODE_ENV = "production"

[runtime]
# The command you want to run inside the packaged environment.
# For a purely static deployment you may not need a runtime at all,
# but for local serving you might run Astro's preview server:
command = "npm run preview --omit=dev"
